# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to understand the dataset by identifying patterns, missing values, outliers, and relationships between variables.

## 📊 Key Highlights

- Handled missing data (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
- Analyzed survival distribution across sex, class, age, and fare
- Visualized distributions using histograms, box plots, and count plots
- Detected outliers in fare and age
- Studied correlations and generated a heatmap
- Extracted key insights from the dataset

## 📁 Dataset Source
